# Glass Purple


**Glass Purple** is a shade that carries the mystery of light captured in stone.

Inspired by the **ancient art of glassmaking**, this luminous purple echoes the rare glimmers found in early glass artifacts â€” pieces that were as much alchemy as craftsmanship. The artisans of antiquity created works that shimmered between solid and ethereal, holding the play of light in their depths.

This color channels that same spirit, a **modern translucence with regal undertones**, meant for those who wish to wear a spark of timeless elegance.

## The Story Behind the Shade
